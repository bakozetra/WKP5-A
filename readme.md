### What did you  succeded to code in this project

- I can open the object by clicking the the button, I use for loop to get the object. I create an html inside the fuction and insert it inside of **div or container** 

- I created new function which is for modal, I succced to open the modal by clicking the button of more information. I can see the picture.

- I added an html to get the modal.

### Does your project meet the requirement
- It is not meet the requirement because :
 1)  I don't know how to loop throught the ingrediends and steps. Using for loop is good but I don't really understand when should use it sometimes.

 2) I could not remove my modal yet.

 3) I am still struggling,When I should I use value and when should pass the value.I think because of that I could get the Ingredient and step.

 4) I could not solve the error in my code " cannot read property target undefined ".
